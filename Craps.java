/* 

COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

This program does a nice job of displaying the basic functionality
of a Craps game, Jack. Well done!

You didn't implement all of the features asked for in the handout--
a default Y/n feature, for example--and where are your @author JavaDocs
for this file? How am I supposed to know to give you credit here? :)

Overall, not bad, though! And a bonus point for breaking out your 
instructions into a separate class. Cool!

SCORE: 13/15 + 1
